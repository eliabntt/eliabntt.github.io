# My personal webpage

This is the code to run a static react-based application as a personal webpage hosted with GitHub Pages.

Project based on the work of [Hashir Shoaeb](https://github.com/hashirshoaeb).

In addition to that I have personally added:
- Google Analytics support
- A working blog page
- The images carousel in the home page
- Several different minor/major addition like SEO support and fixing the redirection. 
- Building sitemap correctly (`npm run sitemap`)
- Email obfuscation

Here I use the master branch as the `developement` branch, while the deploy branch is `gh-pages`
